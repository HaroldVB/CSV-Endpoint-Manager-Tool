# CSV-Endpoint-Manager-Tool
A tool that combines CSV files so you can easily import your devices into Microsoft Endpoint Manager

The script appends all the hardware hashes into 1 file. You can import this file into Microsoft Endpoint Manager to import multiple devices in one import job.

Please reports bugs or comment with improvements I can make!

# Syntax to use the script

`.\CSVConnector.ps1 -inputdir "location of CSV files" -outputdir "where the CSV file will be created"`
